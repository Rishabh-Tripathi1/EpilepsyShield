# EpilepsyShield Chrome Extension

## Problem Statement

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system, leading to seizures and loss of awareness for a period of time. One specific type of epilepsy is Photosensitive Epilepsy, where seizures can be triggered by flashing lights or rapid changes in light and dark patterns. During seizures, individuals may experience uncontrollable jerking movements of their arms and legs. In today's digital age, online platforms like YouTube, with over 2.6 billion monthly users, often use flashy visual elements to capture audience attention. Unfortunately, not all videos contain warnings about these potentially seizure-inducing elements, putting vulnerable individuals at risk. To address this issue, we present EpilepsyShield. 🛡️

## EpilepsyShield

EpilepsyShield is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the safety of individuals with Photosensitive Epilepsy while using YouTube. This innovative extension continuously monitors the content being played on the platform and takes immediate action to prevent users from encountering flashing visuals that could trigger seizures. Here's how it works:

1. **Real-time Video Analysis**: EpilepsyShield continuously captures frames from the video being played on YouTube. 📹

2. **Brightness Comparison**: It calculates the brightness of each frame and compares it to the previous one, tracking changes in luminosity. 🔍

3. **Anomaly Detection**: If a sudden spike in brightness is detected within the video, indicating the presence of flashing elements, EpilepsyShield activates. 🚨

4. **User Alert**: The extension displays a warning notification for the user, alerting them to the potential presence of flashing content in the video. ⚠️

### Technologies Used

EpilepsyShield is built using a combination of web technologies to deliver a seamless and effective user experience. These technologies include:

- **HTML5**: The standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of the extension's user interface. 🌐

- **JavaScript**: The programming language that powers the logic and interactivity of EpilepsyShield, including real-time video analysis. 💻

- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets are employed to style the extension, ensuring a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface. 🎨

- **JSON**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is used for configuration and data exchange within the extension. 📄
