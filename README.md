# Problem Statement
Epilepsy is a disorder that affects the central nervous system, causing seizures and loss of awareness for a period of time. There are certain types of epileptic seizures which can be triggered by different day to day elements. One such kinds is <b>Photosensitive Epilepsy</b>.

### Photosensitive Epilepsy
A person suffering from Photosensitive Epilepsy can get seizures triggered by <i>Flashing lights</i> or the difference of <i>Light</i> and <i>Dark Lights</i>. During the seizures the patient suffers from uncontrollable jerking movements of arms and legs.
In today's flashy world, YouTube has over 2.6 Billion monthly users. In order to attract audience, youtubers use flashy lights and elements in their product. A person suffering from <b>Photosensitive Epilepsy</b> can come across such elements quite easily if there is not prior warning displayed.
Not every video has such warning thus, vulnerable people can suffer seizures. To prevent this mishap, we have <b>EpilepsyShield</b>.

# EpilepsyShield

This is a chrome extension that works while the user is using YouTube. It prevents the user from coming across any flashing visuals on the screen. The extension continuously reads frames from the video and calculates the differences between the brightness of each frame from the previous one to detect any anomaly. When a sudden spike is detected in the video that displays a warning for the user, alerting them about the flashing elements in the video.
